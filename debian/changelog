xpd (0.3.3-1) lucid; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug that leaded to a crash in Windows if user login contains
    non-ASCII characters.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented option list to refresh when changing between
    Infineon 2 and 3 families because of non-ASCII characters in profile name
  * Fixed (again) automatic refresh of COM-ports list in Windows
  * Fixed wrong character set for COM-port errors displayed in Windows
    (actual for non-Latin based locales)

xpd (0.3.2-1) lucid; urgency=low

  * Added support for EB318/CellMan controller
  * Fixed a bug in EB312/CellMan and EB218/Crystalyte profiles
  * Changed the description of PAS Mode for Infineon 2, thanks to "cybershot"

xpd (0.3.1-1) lucid; urgency=low

  * Added Infineon 3 support! Both "stock" and "CellMan" variants are supported.
  * Fixed a long-standing bug that caused XPD to abnormally exit when trying to
    program last controller in internal list (in older version that was
    EB232/Lyen).
  * The serial port list is updated in real time now, at least on Linux
  * Some changes in interface to make it even more end-user friendly

xpd (0.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The serial buffer is flushed before starting reprogramming the controller.
    Sometimes there's garbage there, which results in XPD complaining
    "Invalid reply byte".
  * Some controllers (e.g. I experienced this on sensorless Lyen/EB206) in some
    circumstances (e.g. when enabling regeneration) will send a wrong '0' byte
    when programmed. This version will correctly ignore them, still allowing
    to program such controllers.

  * Better error handling (will report errors rather than hanging)
  * Older PySerial 2.3 is now supported (Debian & Ubuntu)
