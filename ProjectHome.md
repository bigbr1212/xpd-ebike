**XPD** (stands for "eXtended Parameter Designer") is an alternative to "KeyWin e-Bike Lab Parameter Designer" software used to program the so-called "Infineon" e-bike controllers.

  * It provides some additional features missing in the original program, and is generally easier to use.
  * It is written in `Python` and is easily extendable to support custom controllers.
  * It is opensource so you can learn how it works and add unique features to it or customize to suit your own needs.
