Translating TinyAVI to a new language is simple.

1. Copy template.pot to the .po file of your language.
   For example:

        cp po/template.pot po/xyz.po

2. Now touch some source file and run make:

        touch xpd; make update-po

3. Now translate everything you see in your new .po file, and
   install it by running:

        make install
