xpd (0.3.1-1ubuntu1) lucid; urgency=low

  * Added Infineon 3 support! Both "stock" and "CellMan" variants are supported.
  * Fixed a long-standing bug that caused XPD to abnormally exit when trying to
    program last controller in internal list (in older version that was
    EB232/Lyen).
  * The serial port list is updated in real time now, at least on Linux
  * Some changes in interface to make it even more end-user friendly
  * Added support for "Crystalyte" EB218 controller
  * German translation by Maximilian Federle <max.federle@googlemail.com>

xpd (0.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The serial buffer is flushed before starting reprogramming the controller.
    Sometimes there's garbage there, which results in XPD complaining
    "Invalid reply byte".
  * Some controllers (e.g. I experienced this on sensorless Lyen/EB206) in some
    circumstances (e.g. when enabling regeneration) will send a wrong '0' byte
    when programmed. This version will correctly ignore them, still allowing
    to program such controllers.

xpd (0.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Better error handling (will report errors rather than hanging)
  * Older PySerial 2.3 is now supported (Debian & Ubuntu)
