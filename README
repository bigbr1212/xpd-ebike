XPD - eXtended Parameter Designer
---------------------------------

This program was developed to be a drop-in cross-platform replacement
for the widely known in close circles Parameter Design tool (also known
as Keywin e-Bike Lab), used toset the parameters of a e-bike controller
based on the Infineon XC846 microcontroller (and various clones).

This program is written in and requires Python, and also requires the
PyGTK and PySerial (version 2.3 and up) libraries, so install them before
using the program.

To install the program, just execute (as root):

        make install

A detailed list of changes between versions can be found in debian/changelog.
